# jaspreet — Cybersecurity Portfolio

A high-performance, single-page portfolio for **Jaspreet Singh**, an offensive security practitioner. Built with a minimalist "Terminal Green" aesthetic using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🌐 **Live Site**: [https://jaspreetsec.com](https://jaspreetsec.com)

## ⚡ The Aesthetic

The site utilizes a **Hacker Terminal** theme:
- **Primary Color**: `#00ff41` (Matrix/Terminal Green)
- **Background**: `#0a0a0a` (Deep Black)
- **Typography**: Monospace stack for a technical, code-editor feel
- **Interactions**: Functional terminal typing effects and chromatic aberration (glitch) on hover

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 **Single-Page Architecture**: High-speed, anchor-based navigation.
- 📟 **Terminal UI**: Integrated typing animations and command-line prompts (`>`) in the header.
- 🤖 **Agentic AI Focus**: Showcases development of voice-controlled security assistants (Fakir).
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure-Centric**: Highlights distributed VPS management (Cortex, Sanctum, Goliath).
- ⚡ **Zero Dependencies**: No frameworks. Pure vanilla code for a minimal attack surface and instant load times.
- ♿ **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and ARIA-compliant structure.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for SEO and screen readers.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (Variables), Flexbox, and Keyframe animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Custom typing engine and IntersectionObserver for scroll-triggered events.

## ✍️ Blog

Lab write-ups live in `blog/`. To publish one, save `blog/<slug>.html` (from `blog/_template.html`), put images in `blog/images/<slug>/`, and add an entry to `blog/posts.js`. `blog/PROMPT.md` has a copy-paste AI prompt that fills in the template from raw notes.

## 🔒 Security

This is a static site with no backend, minimizing the attack surface. For vulnerability reporting or security-related inquiries, please contact `hello@jaspreetsec.com`.
